# CUDA-Grayscal_Converter
This Python script converts uploaded images to grayscale using PyTorch with GPU (CUDA) acceleration. It auto-creates input/output folders, supports batch processing, applies the standard grayscale formula, shows side-by-side comparisons with Matplotlib, and lets users download all processed results as a ZIP file.
